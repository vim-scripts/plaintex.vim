This package provides a compiler plugin and a filetype plugin for editing plain TeX documents ('ft' = plaintex).  It is intended to be used in addition to the default ftplugin for plaintex, which I also maintain.

The compiler plugin enables you to run tex (or pdftex) on your file with
  :make
and then correct errors using quickfix mode.

The filetype plugin maps " (double quote mark) to insert `` (open quotes) at the start of a quotation, then '' (close quotes) at the end.  It also maps <C-B> to insert "{\bf }" and <C-T> to insert "{\it \/}".  Both of these keys work in Normal, Insert, and Visual modes.
